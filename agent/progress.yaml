      name: Remove All Schema Validation - Let MCP SDK Handle Everything

      completed_date: 2026-02-18
      notes: |
        Completely removed Zod from the entire project. MCP SDK is now responsible
        for ALL validation (input and output), not our tool implementations.
        
        Changes:
        - Removed Zod from all 6 tools (images, web, news, videos, local, summarizer)
        - Removed inputSchema from all tool registrations
        - Changed all params types from typed to any
        - Removed Zod from config.ts (replaced with plain TypeScript types)
        - Removed configSchema export from server.ts
        - Removed Zod from package.json dependencies
        
        Philosophy: Trust the platform. The MCP SDK should handle validation,
        not our implementation. This prevents conflicts with upstream changes
        and simplifies our codebase significantly.

# Next steps (prioritized list)
next_steps:
  - Create design documents for core architectural patterns
  - Document tool implementation pattern for future extensions
  - Create maintenance and contribution guidelines
  - Consider adding integration tests for all tools
  - Document deployment patterns for different environments

# General notes and observations
notes:
  - Project is mature and production-ready (v2.0.72)
  - Well-structured TypeScript codebase with clear separation of concerns
  - Each search tool follows consistent pattern (index.ts, params.ts, types.ts)
  - Configuration supports both environment variables and CLI arguments
  - Dual transport support (STDIO default, HTTP optional) follows MCP conventions
  - Published to NPM and integrated with multiple platforms (Smithery, VS Code, Claude Desktop)
  - Docker support for containerized deployments
  - ACP structure installed but needs project-specific documentation
